# The CRNN that knows what birds sound like

Thank you to [these two](http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/01/cakir.pdf) [lovely papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02291.pdf), [these extremely helpful](https://github.com/sharathadavanne/sed-crnn), [repositories from the challenge](https://github.com/UKYSpeechLab/ukybirddet), and [this ridiculously good series on audio processing for neural nets.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhA3b2k8R3t2Ng1WW_7MiXeh1pfQJQi_P)

Depending on how much I end up actually using code from any of these sources (so far none really, just a lot of inspiration), I'll include licenses and proper credits where needed.
