# The CRNN that knows what birds sound like

Thank you to [this lovely paper](http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/01/cakir.pdf),
and [this extremely helpful Github repo](https://github.com/sharathadavanne/sed-crnn), from which this code was adapted.

Here you can find the license printed in full.
Credit for the setup of the neural net goes to the original authors.

Code modified to accept mp3's or numpy arrays directly, use fewer external libraries, and generally fit my use case better.
